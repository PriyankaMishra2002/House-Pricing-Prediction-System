## Introduction

The House Pricing Prediction System is a machine learning project designed to predict the prices of houses based 
on historical data. By analyzing various features, the system can provide accurate price predictions, helping buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals make informed decisions.

## Features

- Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess data to make it suitable for training.
- Feature Engineering: Extract and select important features for prediction.
- Model Training: Train machine learning models using various algorithms.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R².
- Price Prediction: Predict house prices based on input features.
- User Interface: A simple interface to input data and get price predictions.

## Technologies

- Programming Language: Python
- Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PriyankaMishra2002/house-pricing-prediction-system.git
   cd house-pricing-prediction
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**
   If necessary, create a `.env` file in the root directory and add any required environment variables.

5. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py  # If using Flask or Django, follow the specific framework's instructions
   ```

## Usage

### Data Preparation

1. **Collect Data:**
   - Gather historical housing data including features such as location, size, number of rooms, etc.

2. **Preprocess Data:**
   - Clean the data to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure consistency.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Extract important features and create new ones if necessary.

### Model Training

1. **Select Model:**
   - Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).

2. **Train Model:**
   - Train the model on the prepared dataset.

3. **Evaluate Model:**
   - Evaluate the model using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R².

### Price Prediction

1. **Input Features:**
   - Use the trained model to predict house prices based on new input features.

2. **Get Predictions:**
   - Obtain predicted prices and analyze the results.
